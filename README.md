# Maze Solver App

The application is a game as well as a tool. By pressing "Generate maze", the app generates a
random maze, which you as the player must solve by moving from the green route to the red one
using the WASD buttons on the keyboard. If you manage to get to the end of the maze you get a
score based on how optimal the route you took was.
The app is also a tool, as if you are unable or unwilling to solve the maze, you can press "Give
up" and the app solves the maze for you and shows the shortest possible route on the screen. In addition, you can
save a maze generated by the app by pressing "File", then "Save maze" (saved in CSV format).
Naturally, you can also upload your own maze that you come up with yourself if it has
same CSV format as the app uses. If you have any questions while using the app, you can press "Help",
then "About" for information about the app.
